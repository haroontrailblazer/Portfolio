# Portfolio Website

This repository hosts the deployed source code of my personal portfolio website.

The portfolio showcases my projects, technical skills, certifications, and analytics dashboards, with a focus on:
- AI & Machine Learning projects
- Data analysis using Python and SQL
- Power BI dashboards and visual insights
- End-to-end project documentation

The goal of this site is to provide a clear technical overview of my work for recruiters and collaborators.
